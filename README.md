Implementation of Techniques to create an interactive map


Overview

Leaflet is an open source JavaScript library used to build online map applications. It has most of the mapping features developers want, and it has a simple, readable source code and well-documented API. 

The project developed the technique of the slider which allows users to change the year of the map. The GeoJson converter, which convert csv file to GeoJson file, was also created. Two maps, Fairfax County Map and Mexican Court Case Map were created.

Techniques that can import data to the map and display data through time were developed. Data of Archivo General de la Nacion, Mexican court case data in 18 th century, and data of 2016 Democratic Primary of Fairfax County were used to demonstrate these techniques. A Fairfax County map that can display four different kinds of primary results by moving a scroll bar was created. The Mexican court case map was created which allows users to import csv file. The map displays the information of the court cases on a map using markers. Mexican court case map was tested by importing data in Archivo General de la Nacion (acordtest).

The finalized Fairfax County Map is Slider_Nap_Online.html in FairfaxCountyMap folder and the finalized Mexican Court Case Map is mccmap.html in MexicanCourtCaseMap folder.
